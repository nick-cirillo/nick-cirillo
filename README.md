## Nick Cirillo

I'm a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania studying computer science. I'm interested in machine learning and software dev, and I'm currently a member of Penn Spark on the Red Development team, as well as VP Blue in which I co-direct our bootcamp - you can learn more about Spark [here](https://pennspark.org/). 

You can reach me at [ncirillo@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:ncirillo@seas.upenn.edu)!
